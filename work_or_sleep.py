# Prompt the user for a day of the week just like the previous 
# problem. But this time, print "Go to work" if it's a work day
#  and "Sleep in" if it's a weekend day. Example session:

# $ python3 work_or_sleep_in.py
# Day (0-6)? 5
# Go to work
# $ python work_or_sleep_in.py
# Day (0-6)? 6
# Sleep in


# Prompt user for input

# day_number = int(input("Day (0-6)? "))
# if 1 <= day_number <= 5:
#     print("Go to work")
# elif day_number == 0 or day_number == 6:
#     print("Sleep in")
# else:
#     print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 0 and 6.")
