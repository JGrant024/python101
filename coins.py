# Write a program that will prompt you for how many coins you want. Initially you have no coins. It will ask you if you want a coin? If you type "yes", it will give you one coin, and print out the current tally. If you type no, it will stop the program. Example run:$ python3 coins.py



# You have 0 coins.
# Do you want another? yes
# You have 1 coins.
# Do you want another? yes
# You have 2 coins.
# Do you want another? no
# Bye
